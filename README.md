# kaios-solidjs-starter

A simple starter template for building a KaiOS app using SolidJS and TypeScript.

### Development and testing

`npm run dev` builds the app in watch mode and serves the site. Great for testing your app in a desktop browser.

### Deploying to a device

1. Connect your device to your computer and make sure it appears in WebIDE.
2. `npm run build`
3. In WebIDE, load the `/public` folder as a packaged app.

Big shout-out to [Garret Downs](https://nothing.dev/) and the contributors of [kaios-svelte-starter](https://github.com/kaios-community/kaios-svelte-starter), the repo of which this code is **heavily** based

The test app in this repo is based off of the [Typescript template](https://github.com/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts) in the official SolidJS repo
